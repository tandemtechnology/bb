bb is an agentic IDE that can control itself. You can seamlessly
orchestrate all of your favorite coding agents together and have them
programmatically use bb too.

Every surface — the desktop app, web app, CLI, and HTTP API — is a first-class
way to drive bb. Work runs in threads you can follow live, steer at any point,
or hand off to another agent.

> [!NOTE]
> bb is in active development. Core architecture is stable, but workflows
> and surfaces are still evolving.

## Use bb

### Download the desktop app

The recommended way to start using bb is the desktop app:

**[Download the latest desktop app](https://github.com/get-bb/bb/releases/tag/desktop-latest)**

The desktop build is currently macOS Apple Silicon (arm64) only. Intel Mac and
Linux users should run bb with `npx` instead. On Windows, run bb inside
[WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install):
install WSL2 first, then run the same `npx` command below from your WSL2 (Linux)
shell. Native Windows PowerShell and CMD are not supported.

Early adopters can install
**[bb Nightly](https://github.com/get-bb/bb/releases/tag/desktop-nightly)**
alongside the stable desktop app. It has a separate application identity,
yellow icon, and auto-update feed.

### Or run it anywhere with npx

```bash
npx bb-app@latest
```

Then open `http://localhost:38886`.

To run the newest automated build instead:

```bash
npx bb-app@nightly
```

bb uses the provider CLI you already have authenticated.

For install requirements, provider setup, configuration, and package-focused
docs, start with
[`packages/bb-app`](./packages/bb-app/README.md).

### Telemetry

**This fork ships with telemetry disabled by default.** Upstream bb enables it
by default; this fork is used for PHI-adjacent work under a BAA, so usage data
only leaves the machine on a deliberate opt-in.

Upstream behaviour, for reference: production runs (the desktop app and
`npx bb-app`) send anonymous usage telemetry (app starts, thread creation
counts, and user message counts) to help understand adoption. Identification is
a random per-install id stored in your data dir — no user, host, project,
workspace, or message content is ever attached. Development/source runs never
send.

Here, none of that happens unless you set `BB_TELEMETRY=true`. With telemetry
disabled nothing is created at all, not even the install id. See
[`docs/configuration.md`](./docs/configuration.md#telemetry) and
[`apps/server/src/services/system/telemetry.ts`](./apps/server/src/services/system/telemetry.ts).

## Development

Use the development loop when working on bb itself:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

That starts the Vite app and proxies API and WebSocket traffic to a separate
dev server. The launcher prints the actual ports at startup. Each checkout gets
a data directory under
`~/.bb-dev/<checkout-instance>/` and deterministic high ports derived from the
checkout path. The checkout instance id is the sanitized path to the checkout,
relative to your home directory, plus a short hash suffix. Separate worktrees
can run alongside each other and the packaged `npx bb-app@latest` instance.

To run that same source dev server with the Electron desktop shell:

```bash
pnpm dev:desktop
```

This uses `scripts/bb-dev-app current --desktop`, which stops stale launcher
sessions, checks dependencies and native modules, starts the source dev server,
then opens the desktop shell against that dev app. The launcher prints the web
URL but does not open a browser unless you pass `--open`.

To use the dev app from another machine over Tailscale, run `pnpm dev`, note the
printed app port, and publish the loopback Vite listener:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:<app-port>
```

Then open `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net`. Source dev binds both the Vite
app and main server to loopback by default; Vite continues to proxy API and
WebSocket traffic.

To use the component storybook from another machine, run:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

Ladle binds to all interfaces and configures its HMR WebSocket to use the
browser's current host instead of `localhost`. Do not run `pnpm storybook` on an
untrusted network.

Development behavior is intentionally split:

- the app hot reloads itself
- the server does not hot reload
- the host daemon does not hot reload

When you want the server and host daemon to pick up the latest build output, use:

```bash
pnpm dev:restart
pnpm dev:restart-server
pnpm dev:restart-host-daemon
```

These rebuild first, then restart only the targeted stateful services.

To run a production-mode build from a source checkout:

```bash
pnpm start
```

That builds only the app, server, and host-daemon runtime artifacts, then runs
the launcher directly against those workspace outputs. Use the `bb-app`
tarball smoke task when validating the published `npx bb-app@latest` package
layout.

```bash
pnpm bb --help            # built CLI, targets the default/prod instance
pnpm reset                # clear production state

pnpm bb:dev --help        # source CLI, targets this checkout's dev instance
pnpm reset:dev            # clear this checkout's dev state

pnpm reset:all            # clear both production and dev states
```

These reset commands prompt for confirmation before deleting anything.

## Troubleshooting

### `Could not locate the bindings file`

bb uses native add-ons, for example `better-sqlite3` and `@parcel/watcher`. npm
downloads or builds those binaries in a package install script. If npm does not
run install scripts, the binaries are absent. bb then stops at startup with this
error:

```
Error: Could not locate the bindings file. Tried:
 → .../node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/better_sqlite3.node
```

The usual cause is `ignore-scripts=true` in your `~/.npmrc`. Set the
`npm_config_ignore_scripts` environment variable to let this one command run its
install scripts:

```bash
npm_config_ignore_scripts=false npx bb-app@latest
```

For a permanent install with the same setting, use:

```bash
npm_config_ignore_scripts=false npm install -g bb-app
bb-app
```

The environment variable applies to that one command only. Keep
`ignore-scripts=true` in your `~/.npmrc` if you want it for security.

The same error has other causes. A Node.js major-version change after the
install causes it. A copy of `node_modules` from a different operating system,
CPU architecture, or libc variant also causes it. To recover, install the
package again, or run `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.
