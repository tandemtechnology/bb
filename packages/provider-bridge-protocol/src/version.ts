/**
 * The bb Provider Bridge Protocol version.
 *
 * Negotiated in both directions during `initialize`. Bump only for changes an
 * older bridge or runtime cannot tolerate: removing a method, changing the
 * meaning of an existing field, or tightening a previously lenient parse.
 * Additive changes (new optional capability, new method a bridge may not
 * implement, new notification the runtime may not understand) do NOT bump the
 * version — unknown methods answer -32601, unknown notifications are ignored,
 * and unknown capability fields pass through. That tolerance is the point of
 * the protocol: bridges version with their plugin, not with the daemon.
