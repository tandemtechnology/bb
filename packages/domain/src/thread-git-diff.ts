 * the table-of-contents row the paginated diff tab fetches before any patch.
 *
 * Lives in @bb/domain (not host-workspace) because the host-daemon-contract RPC
 * result schema validates it and cannot import host-workspace.
 *
 * - `statusLetter` is git's raw `--name-status` letter; the server maps it to
 *   the product change kind.
 * - `previousPath` is the rename/copy source for `R`/`C`; `null` otherwise.
 * - `additions`/`deletions` come from `--numstat`; binary files report `0` and
 *   set `binary: true`.
 * - `origin` distinguishes working-tree untracked files (which require
 *   alternate-index handling) from tracked files.
