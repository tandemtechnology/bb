/**
 * The dynamic ACP tier.
 *
 * Every other provider is a plugin declaration in the registry. ACP ids are
 * different: known agents (`acp-opencode`, `acp-omp`, …) and user-configured
 * custom agents (`acp-<slug>`) are resolved from launch specs at request time
 * and are never declared, so they need a shared capability answer. This module
 * is that answer — the registry's accessors fall back to it, and the listing
 * composers build their `ProviderInfo`s from it.
 *
 * Capabilities that vary per ACP agent rather than across the whole tier (for
 * example manual compaction, which OpenCode supports and Cursor does not) are
 * declared on the agent record itself and resolved by
 * `system/acp-launch-spec.ts::resolveAcpAgentCapabilitiesForProviderId`.
 *
 * The external agent owns model selection, tool execution, and session naming,
 * so BB-side capabilities stay minimal. Permission modes are enforced
 * cooperatively by the ACP bridge (permission-request policy + client fs write
 * policy). Fork support is the declared offer; each agent's real answer is
 * negotiated at the bridge handshake before the unstable ACP session/fork
 * request is sent. Service tier is supported because Cursor exposes a `-fast`
 * model tail that the bridge resolves from the tier rather than fanning fast
 * variants out as separate model-list entries.
